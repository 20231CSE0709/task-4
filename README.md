# task-4
The AI & ML Internship focuses on building a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. The main objective is to help participants understand how logistic regression works and how to evaluate its performance. To complete this task, you're expected to choose a suitable binary classification dataset (like the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset), perform data preprocessing such as train-test splitting and feature standardization, and fit a logistic regression model using tools like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The task also emphasizes understanding and calculating evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. A key part of the task is exploring the sigmoid function and learning how to tune the classification threshold for better performance. Additionally, the task provides common interview questions related to logistic regression to aid in conceptual clarity.
